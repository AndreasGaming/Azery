	//About
	/////////
		This project started out as a port of subVersion to internal, with parts (of an old version) of
		SudoMod implemented. After having played around with this hybrid for a while and reading
		through the SudoMod code, I decided to re-write a large part. subVersion 2.0 is the result.
		subVersion 2.1 is further modified version that uses direct function calls, instead of the
		previously used native invoker.
